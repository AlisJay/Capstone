# CapstoneThis repo contains annotated code created for the John Hopkins' Coursera data science capstone project. ###NextWord shiny appThe culmination of the code in this repo was the creation of the NextWord shiny app. for the app see: https://alisjay.shinyapps.io/nextwordFor a 5 slide presentation on the app see: http://rpubs.com/AlisJay/NextWord###Structure of repoThe code has been broken into two sections1. Code used in creating the processed data.  (data formation)2. Prediction model and shiny app code (prediction)**Data formation**In this section the process is broken into four sections:1. Clean and load2. Form3. Merge4. SplitThese code chunks run through the process of forming the final data. The unique functions used within them can be found in the Functions sub folder. - Clean Corpus, contains functions used in 1. Clean and load- SplitGram, contains functions used in 2. Form- MergeData, contains functions used in 3. Merge- no custom functions are used in 4. Split**Prediction**In this section the prediction functions are split over three .R files: Predict 1, Predict 2 and Predict 3. Also included are the server.R and ui.R files used in the NextWord app.
